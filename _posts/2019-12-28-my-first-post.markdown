After countless hours of figuring out how to use Jekyll on Github Pages I've finally managed to pull through and open my personal Github user page! Here I hope to share stories, guides and projects that I want to share. Sometimes there will even be the odd essay on a topic that has recently gripped my attention.

I am so excited to begin my journey on Github!

Here a Python code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
def print1to10(name)
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(i, end=', ')
print1to10()
#=> prints '1, 2, ..., 10'
{% endhighlight %}

If you're wondering just where I get all my ideas and inspirations, well let me tell you... [Google][google-web]{:target="_blank"} has been a great inspiration and when scrolling through the endless stream of content on [YouTube][yt-web]{:target="_blank"}, ideas just come flying to me!
